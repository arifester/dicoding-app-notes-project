# Dicoding Notes App Project
This Notes App serves as the primary submission project in Dicoding's Learn Front-End Web Development Fundamentals course.
Developed entirely with Vanilla JavaScript, Web Components, and CSS Grid, it demonstrates a strong command of core web technologies without relying on frameworks.
The project aims for a perfect score by fulfilling all optional criteria, featuring a fully responsive layout, real-time form validation, and reactive custom attributes to deliver a polished user experience.
